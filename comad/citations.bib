  abstract  = "Almost all animals and plants are inhabited by diverse
               communities of microorganisms, the microbiota, thereby forming
               an integrated entity, the metaorganism. Natural selection should
               favor hosts that shape the community composition of these
               microbes to promote a beneficial host-microbe symbiosis. Indeed,
               animal hosts often pose selective environments, which only a
               subset of the environmentally available microbes are able to
               colonize. How these microbes assemble after colonization to form
               the complex microbiota is less clear. Neutral models are based
               on the assumption that the alternatives in microbiota community
               composition are selectively equivalent and thus entirely shaped
               by random population dynamics and dispersal. Here, we use the
               neutral model as a null hypothesis to assess microbiata
               composition in host organisms, which does not rely on invoking
               any adaptive processes underlying microbial community assembly.
               We show that the overall microbiota community structure from a
               wide range of host organisms, in particular including previously
               understudied invertebrates, is in many cases consistent with
               neutral expectations. Our approach allows to identify individual
               microbes that are deviating from the neutral expectation and are
               therefore interesting candidates for further study. Moreover,
               using simulated communities, we demonstrate that transient
               community states may play a role in the deviations from the
               neutral expectation. Our findings highlight that the
               consideration of neutral processes and temporal changes in
               community composition are critical for an in-depth understanding
               of microbiota-host interactions.",
